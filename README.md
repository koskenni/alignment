# alignment
Letter by letter alignment of words

Methods for careful letter by letter alignment for e.g. cognate words in historical linguistics or 
when matching different stems of a words with each other. Alignment adds zero symbols where necessary 
in order to match words or stems that differ in length. Alignment is particularly important in 
two-level morphology because the alignment determines what morphophonemes there will be.

Linguistically relevant criteria are needed exploited for good quality alignment.
